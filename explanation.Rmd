Inroduction
========================================================

This presentation will introduce the Movie charts webapp 
that was a Course Project for the Developing Data Products class of 
the Johns Hopkins University, hosted by Coursera.

Access to the application

- [Live version](https://oszkar.shinyapps.io/developingdataproductsclass/) on ShinyApps
- [Code and data](https://github.com/Oszkar/developingdataproductsclass) on GitHub

Movie charts can run in any modern browser, suggested resolution is full HD. 
Mobile devices are technically supported, hovewer, due to the nature of the charts, the
app might not be that useful on small screens.

Movie Charts
========================================================

Movie charts is a simple webapplication that visualizes some properties of 
the [IMDB](http://imdb.com) top 250 movies. The dataset used by the webapp also contains 
the [Rotten Tomatoes](http://www.rottentomatoes.com) (RT) data for those movies so 
comparisons between the two sites are possible.

Movie charts also offers (a very dummy) prediction tool for predicting movie earnings. 


Functionalities
========================================================

- Ratings: IMDB and RT ratings can be visualized against each other or against release
date of the movie. Bubble size of the chart is also customizable, it can correspond to 
IMDB/Rotten Tomatoe rating number or the [Metascore](http://www.metacritic.com). 
Lastly, the color of the bubbles also customizable, it can represent MPAA rating or release data 
(exact year or decade)
- Box office: A simpler chart where box office can be visualized agains the IMDB 
or RT data or release date. Also a prediction tool can be used to predict box office earnings.
- Data retrieval: Description and code describing how the movie data was acquired
- Data and Data download: Online viewer and downloader for the movie data
- Help / Manual: a simple help page

Technical details
========================================================

- Movie charts uses standard ShinyApp features, using `fluidFlow`s on several `tabPanel`s
- Data is loaded from a local JSON that was acquired via the [OMDB API](http://omdbapi.com). 
See Data retrieval menu in the app for more details
- `shinyAce` library is used to display code
- For the box office prediction, the simplest possible prediction is used by fitting a linear model (trendline) 
on the data and using that line to predict Y values for X values that are entered by the user
- Charts are displayed using the `googleVis` package
- This presentation is done in R Studio's R presenter (.Rpres)
